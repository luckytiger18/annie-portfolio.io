  "aboutDev": "I am attending UC Berkeley Extension as a Full Stack Web Developer student. I came from a background in Psychology and am transitioning into computers. While transitioning out of my previous seven year Behavioral Interventionist career, I got a chance to work at a tech company. While there, I was exposed to various imperfect in-house tools which inspired me to research about the software developement process into making things better. Lastly, on my free time, I enjoy long walks with my dog, Popcorn and watercolor painting.",
